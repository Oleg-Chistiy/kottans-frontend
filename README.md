# kottans-frontend


## Stage 0. Self-Study

Hello. My name is Oleg.

I just started learning Front-End and this is my repository for the course from Cottans

All exercises are new for me, but they are very informative and interesting.

I hope I get real programming knowledge here.


## Git Basics

I listened two weeks of [Introduction to Git and GitHub course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github):

* [Introduction to Git and GitHub Week 1](https://github.com/Oleg-Chistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Week%201.jpg)
* [Introduction to Git and GitHub Week 2](https://github.com/Oleg-Chistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Week%202.jpg)

And I completed all the tasks on the site [learngitbranching.js.org](learngitbranching.js.org):

* [Basics](https://github.com/Oleg-Chistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Основи.jpg)
* [Remote repositories](https://github.com/Oleg-Chistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Удаленные%20репозитории.jpg)
