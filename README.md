# kottans-frontend


## Stage 0. Self-Study

Hello. My name is Oleg.

I just started learning Front-End and this is my repository for the course from Cottans

All exercises are new for me, but they are very informative and interesting.

I hope I get real programming knowledge here.


## Git Basics

I listened two weeks of [Introduction to Git and GitHub course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github):

* [Introduction to Git and GitHub Week 1](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Week%201.jpg)
* [Introduction to Git and GitHub Week 2](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Week%202.jpg)

This is very clear and useful material for a beginner like me.
I liked the lecturer's style of presentation and I have already applied some of the knowledge from this course

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

And I completed all the tasks on the site [learngitbranching.js.org](https://learngitbranching.js.org):

* [Basics](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Основи.jpg)
* [Remote repositories](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/Git%20Intro/Удаленные%20репозитории.jpg)

This is the best trainer for learning Git. Everything is very clear and understandable. I advise everyone.
I especially liked the commands `rebase`, `cherry-pick` and `origin`. 

And I also found a friend @NadiaVorontsova , who helps me in this course


## Linux CLI, and HTTP
I took a mini course Linux command line. [Linux Survival](https://linuxsurvival.com) (4 modules):

* [Quiz #1](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/task_linux_cli/Quiz%201.jpg)
* [Quiz #2](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/task_linux_cli/Quiz%202.jpg)
* [Quiz #3](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/task_linux_cli/Quiz%203.jpg)
* [Quiz #4](https://github.com/OlegChistiy/kottans-frontend/blob/main/assets/task_linux_cli/Quiz%204.jpg)

This is my first time using Linux command line. And the first meeting was successful. It was easier than I thought.

I read two articles about HTTP:

* [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know—Part 1](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-1--net-31177)
* [HTTP: The Protocol Every Web Developer Must Know—Part 2](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/http-the-protocol-every-web-developer-must-know-part-2--net-31155)

I can say that the articles are very boring, but very useful and informative. I understand the general meaning now. And in my future work, I will study the details of the HTTPS protocol.
